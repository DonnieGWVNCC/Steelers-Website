                            <p><strong>The Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> were established on July 8th of 1933 by Arthur J. Rooney. The Steelers legacy of winning started long before I became a fan in 2005. The Steelers became the first NFL team with six super bowl wins, as they won in 1975, 1976, 1979, 1980, 2006, and 2009. The New England Patriots also have six Superbowl wins, but we will always be the first team in history to have reached that achievement.</p>

                            <h3>Super Bowl Victory (2005)</h3>
                            <p>The year I started watching the Pittsburgh Steelers just so happened to be the year they won their 5th Superbowl. On February 5th, 2006, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Superbowl XL. 
                                This year was a special year, as Jerome Bettis, an all-time Steeler great announced this would be his last season as a running back for the Steelers. Jerome, also known as "The Bus" held his farewll tour in 
                                the 2005 season, hoping to end it on the highest note possible, winning the Superbowl. The Steelers made sure to make that happen, and to cap off the Cinderella story, the Superbowl was held in Detroit, Michigan,
                                Jerome's hometown. Jerome rode out to the sunset as the Steelers handled business, winning 21-10. Also, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger became the youngest quarterback to win a Superbowl at 23 years-old.

                            <h3>Super Bowl Victory (2008)</h3>
                            <p>Not long after their success in 2005, the Steelers once again found themselves in Superbowl 43, held on February 1st, 2009. The Steelers have been working their way to earn their 6th Superbowl victory, to be the first team ever to achieve 
                                this feat. Steeler fans often referenced as the goal of getting "one for the thumb", and now was finally the oppourtunity to earn it. As the Steelers went up against the Arizona Cardinals, history was going to be made in more ways than one. 
                                James Harrison intercepted the Cardinals quarterback, Kurt Warner, and returned the interception for a 100-yard touchdown, making it the longest play in Superbowl history at that time. It is now the second longest as the record has since been 
                                broken. The Steelers also made history by defeating the Cardinals in a down to the wire game that saw Santonio Holmes catch the game-winning touchdown. The Steelers defeated the Cardinals 27-32 and became the first team to reach six Superbowl victories.

                            <h3>Big Ben's Final Home Game (Jan. 3rd, 2022)</h3>
                            <p>Ever since my fandom begun for the Pittsburgh Steelers back in 2005, I have only known one quarterback, and that quarterback is Ben Roethlisberger, also know as "Big Ben". I have watched Ben play in several games 
                                before, however, this cold night in January was a once in a lifetime experience. The time had come for Ben to hang up the cleats after 18 successful years as the Steelers quarterback. Although the Steelers were 
                                going to make the playoffs his last season, he had one last final home game that fell on January 4th, 2021. My girlfriend and I were given tickets to this game for Christmas from my parents, and I couldn't believe 
                                I was going to be in attendance for the last home game of a Steelers legend who played such a huge part in my childhood. We arrived at the game early to get to our seats, and the weather was as cold and harsh as it 
                                could've been, but there was nowhere else I would've rather been. The Steelers were pitted against their division rivals, the Cleveland Browns, which made it all the more sweet when we won 26-14. After the game, an 
                                emotional Big Ben made a lap around the whole stadium taking it all in one last time. It was a night that I will never forget, and a night that the little kid in me came alive again for just a few hours. Thank you Ben.
